1. 
	p_lnk: Link pointer for ready/sem. wait list
  	ret_val: Return value upon completion of a wait 
  	tsk_stack: Current task Stack pointer (R13)
  	stack: Pointer to Task Stack memory block  
  	OS_XCB Casted as OS_TCB will keep the p_lnk field as it also has this field.

2. 	mp_tcb: the memory pool of tcb (U32)
	mp_stk: Memory pool for System stack allocation

3.  What registers are saved on the task stack?	
		R1-R12,LR registers
	How to determine the start and end address of a task stack?
		top of stack: &p_TCB->stack[size]
		bottom of stack: top - 16
	How to determine the current stack pointer of a task that is not in RUNNING state?
		rt_get_PSP() .... p_TCB->tsk_stack
	How to determine the current stack pointer of a task that is in RUNNING state?
		p_TCB->tsk_stack

	#include <rtl.h>

	/* Reserve a memory for 20 blocks of 12-bytes. */
	_declare_box(mympool,20,12);

	void membox_test (void) {
	  U8 *box;
	  U8 *cbox;

	  cbox = _calloc_box (mympool);
	   ..
	  _free_box (mympool, box);
	  _free_box (mympool, cbox);
	}

	Write one line of code to initialize the "mympool".
		_init_box (mympool, sizeof (mympool), 20);
	What is the corresponding kernel function of _alloc_box()?
		rt_alloc_box
	What is the corresponding kernel function of _free_box()?		
		rt_free_box

5.
	rt_put_prio()
		Put task identified with "p_task" into list ordered by priority. "p_CB" points to head of list; list has always an element at end with a priority less than "p_task->prio".  

  	rt_get_first()
  		Get task at head of list: it is the task with highest priority.

6.
	
	rt_block()
  		Block running task and choose next ready task. 

  	rt_dispatch()
  	  	Dispatch next task if any identified or dispatch highest ready task  

7. 
	Line 54:    p_TCB->ret_val = OS_R_MBX;
	When you just recieved a or are waiting for a message then you dont need to set the return value as it is already set

8. 	They use the data structure OS_XCB
